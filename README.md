Ember Generators (Brunch)
================================

These are the generators used for Brunch, but you can include
them into any project you want.

They aren't done :)

Installation
------------

`npm install loom-generators-ember-brunch --save`

The --save is important, loom needs to read your package.json to find
the generators.

Generator Examples
------------------

```sh
generate component x-buttonset
generate controller users/mini-profile
generate controller application type:array
generate helper capitalize
generate mixin queryable
generate model user name:string age:number
generate route index
generate template profile
generate view index
```

That's pretty much everything.
